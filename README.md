# Appveyor Matrix Experiments

* [Full build history for this repo.](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/relsqui/matrix-repro/history)

This repo is for experimenting with Appveyor config quickly, although once I had the infrastructure set up I started using it for mini work-adjacent code experiments generally. Here are some things I've done with it so far:

1. [Initial setup of the Appveyor config in this repo.](01-initial-setup.md)
2. [Managing multiple `extra` jobs.](02-multiple-extra-jobs.md)
3. [Stop build on packaging failure.](03-stop-on-failure.md)
4. [How do .catch and .finally interact?](04-catch-finally.md)

I will add more files as I do more experiments.
